The issue lies in the spacing and unit consistency within the `calc()` expression.  Incorrect spacing around the `+` and `-` operators, or a mix of units (e.g., pixels and percentages), will often lead to unexpected behavior.

**Corrected Code (bugSolution.css):**

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% + 20px);
  height: calc(100vh - 50px);
}
```

**Explanation:**

* Ensure spaces are present around the `+` and `-` operators within the `calc()` function. 
* Maintain consistent units throughout the calculation.  Mixing units without explicit conversion can lead to errors.
